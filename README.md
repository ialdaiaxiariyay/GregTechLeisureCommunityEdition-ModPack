## GregTech Leisure Community Edition, as a continuation project of the original modpack, preserves the core design philosophy while further optimizing the experience and expanding content through community collaboration. Below is an integration of its key features and development directions:

# I. Core Design Continuity: Low Barrier to Entry and Process Optimization
Difficulty Control
The community edition maintains its "leisure-oriented" positioning and will further strengthen this focus.

## II. Technical Architecture Upgrade and Stability Maintenance
Underlying Dependency Optimization
Continuously updates GTCEu Modern to incorporate various bug fixes, such as fluid isolation mechanisms.

The community edition extends the original leisure version's design philosophy of "reducing pressure without sacrificing depth," while actively welcoming skilled players to participate in development, providing additional technical support and content expansion.
